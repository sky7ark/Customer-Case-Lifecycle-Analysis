# Customer-Case-Lifecycle-Analysis

As part of enhancing my Salesforce reporting and analytics project, I developed a new Customer Case Lifecycle Analysis feature to better understand customer experience and case management flow â€” directly aligning with real-world business analyst responsibilities.

ðŸ”¹ Objective:
To measure the efficiency of customer case handling and improve visibility into case resolution performance.

ðŸ”¹ What I Built:
Created a Salesforce report called Customer Case Lifecycle Analysis
Grouped results by Case Owner and Status to identify workload distribution and bottlenecks
Added a Row-Level Formula to calculate:
Average Days to Close Case = DATEVALUE(CloseDate) - DATEVALUE(CreatedDate)
Enhanced the dashboard with a Case Resolution KPI metric, showing the average days open or closed
Designed a bar chart and metric component to visualize case performance and highlight aging cases

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights:
This report helps identify which cases take the longest to resolve, understand case distribution across owners, and ensure a smoother customer case lifecycle â€” providing actionable insights for service improvement.

ðŸ”¹ Skills & Tools:
Salesforce Reports â€¢ Dashboards â€¢ Row-Level Formulas â€¢ Case Management Analytics â€¢ Data Visualization â€¢ KPI Reporting

ðŸ”¹ Outcome:
Transformed customer case data into measurable performance indicators, improving visibility into resolution times and supporting better prioritization of critical cases.
